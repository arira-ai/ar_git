## Why This Repo?

Git and GitHub are **foundational skills** for every software engineer, DevOps engineer, and SRE.
This repository is designed to take a **complete beginner** and build a **strong, practical understanding** of:

* How Git works internally
* How GitHub enables collaboration
* How real teams use branches, pull requests, and reviews
* How to recover safely from mistakes

This repo focuses on **hands-on learning**, not command memorization.
